            <p>Hello! Can you hear me? Testing!</p>
            <p>Ahem. Now that we're all set, here's a brief explanation:</p>
            <p><em><strong>A long time ago, in a galaxy far away...</strong></em></p>
            <p>No! That's a different story. This one really only started about a month ago, when I actively started coding with HTML and JavaScript. I learned HTML in middle school, but at that time HTML was pretty much the only thing used in web design. Since then so much more has been added! While working in a project management capacity for a software company, I got an up-close look at the way web work is done in the modern age of HTML5, CSS3, and cool JavaScript interactivity.</p>
            <p>I started the Khan Academy Intro to JS course months back out of curiosity, but my work schedule caused it to fall by the wayside. After some developments at that company, I suddenly had some time to sit down and learn! In the Khan HTML course, one of the assignements was to make an HTML blog format. I thought that continuing the  may be a good way to improve my web design skills. I've been experimenting with CSS and JS, and I plan to continue implementing new design updates to this page.</p>

          <h2 class="pageSubTitle">Posted May 27, 2015</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p> First experiments with HTML/CSS design, and I plan to keep updating with new features. At some point I would like a Header/Nav design, where header scrolls away, but nav fits to top. NAv may wait until there are other things to link to, but may get some things up to <a class="link" href="https://www.codepen.io"> Codepen</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.github.com"> GitHub</a>, and then start linking up a cool Nav. </p>

          <p>I've been taking a lot of inspiration (and actual pieces of code) from cool-looking websites. Some popular ones have been  <a href="http://www.lesscss.org">Lesscss.org</a> and <a href="http://www.stripe.com">Stripe.com</a>. They both have very cool color schemes and layouts. Actually very similar, and then I noticed there were some similar elements in there as well. <strong>DING!</strong> That's when I fugured out what Bootstrap is. After looking through the source for a number of cool sites, I quickly realized that Bootstrap is the training wheels of the internet.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Since my last post, I've been playing around with a lot of Bootstrap plugins. I switched the layout of this page to the other design I was working on, since it lends itself better to the blog format. This meant that I needed a new main web page design. So I started a main page from scrap(ish) using some Bootstrap code. Right now it is very basic, but I expect to have it working properly within the next day or two. Once I have that up and running, I'll get the styling on point.</p>
          <p>
          </p>
          Hopefully I can make a template or two, and I can use (and tweak) those for client web design. That will hopefully make for a more efficient design process for client work.

          <p>Continuing work on my main page, and its going well. I've been playing with bootstrap elements, and tweaking them around some. Also helped implement a modal pop-up contact form on the <a href="https://www.lottosurfer.com">Lotto Surfer</a> website yesterday, and it clooks pretty cool. Went through this page today also to clean out some garbage code. In doing that, and deleting some redundant source references, I got the dropdown menu in the nav bar working properly. Now I just need to swap in my own links. </p>
          <p>I'll be building some database driven pages to link to. I plan to get some practice storing form information, and building log-in and payment portals. Lets See!</p>

        <section>
          <p>Since last post I've been doing a <strong>LOT</strong> of reading on AWS server set up. Last night I started my free tier, and fired up an Ubuntu Linux EC2 instance. I found a few walkthroughs for installing the LAMP server stack. No two walkthroughs were the same, which was a little unnerving. Nevertheless, I followed the common elements of the few guides I was using, and it seems that I have things set up properly. That is hypothetical since I haven't figured out how to link my GitHub into the stack yet. Soon.   </p>
          <p>I am also going to put a little To-Do List together for items that I would like to accomplish on this page so that I have a more focused approach.</p>

              <p>After I reread the title, I must specify that General Tinkering is not a person. Like General Electric. That's just what I've been up to for the last few days. A little bit of work for <a href="https://www.lottosurfer.com">Lotto Surfer</a>, a little bit of work for <a href="http://www.convictioneliquids.com">Conviction E-liquids</a>, a little work on <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, and then some work on fixing my AWS Apache webserver, and then work on my website to make it worth displaying.</p>
              <p>Due to the unpredictability of my schedule, I am setting up a task list for myself so that my work on the website has more focus.</p>
